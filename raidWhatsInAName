#My first reaction to this code was slight confusion, because it wasn't really clear what was being done or why the variables were named that way. I took another close look at the code, and at the math specifically. Finally, when I saw the math having 2 numbers for one, and 3 for 2, I realized that this code is likely to calculate area and volume. The shapes are probably just a plane and a cube.
